# libcraft

General-purpose Minecraft types and functions for Rust. Work in progress; code is being moved from the [Feather repository](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather).

Once finished, this crate will provide:
* Block struct with access to properties, block state values, and IDs
* Item struct with access to properties and IDs
* Inventory and [window](https://wiki.vg/Inventory) definitions
* An implementation of Minecraft's [in-memory chunk data structure](https://wiki.vg/Chunk_Format)
* The [JSON Text/ChatComponent API](https://wiki.vg/Chat)
* Region file loading
* Packets from the [protocol](https://wiki.vg/Protocol)

Each piece of functionality is in its own crate. All `libcraft-*` crates are reexported from the main `libcraft` crate.
